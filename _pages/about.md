I am a computational linguist and an Assistant Professor at UC San Diego 
with appointments in [Linguistics](https://linguistics.ucsd.edu/) 
and the [Halƒ±cƒ±oƒülu Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/).

I am the PI of UC San Diego's Learning, Meaning, and Natural language lab (LeMüçãN Lab).
The group focuses on interdisciplinary research in linguistics, computational cognitive modeling, and natural language processing.
We use advances in machine learning to understand why human language is the way it is, 
how children come to acquire it, and how information is conveyed across multiple channels. 
We use insights from linguistics and cognitive science to advance compute- and data-efficient learning in LMs 
and to evaluate and interpret how LMs learn and represent grammatical structures and meaning.

Prior to coming to UC San Diego:
- I did my Postdoc at ETH Z√ºrich, were I was affiliated with [Rycolab](https://rycolab.io/) (PI: [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/)).
- I completed my PhD at NYU in Linguistics (Dissertation: "Artificial Neural Networks as Models of Human Language Acquisition"), 
where I was supervised by [Sam Bowman](https://sleepinyourhat.github.io/) 
and affiliated with [CAP Lab](https://caplabnyu.github.io/) (PI: [Tal Linzen](https://tallinzen.net/)).
- I received BAs in Linguistics and Music Theory from Brown University (Thesis: "The Syntax of Coordination and Discontinuity in a Combinatory Categorial Grammar", advisor: Pauline Jacobson).
