LeM🍋N Lab specializes on interdisciplinary research in linguistics, computational cognitive modeling, and natural language processing. 
We use advances in machine learning to understand why human language is the way it is, 
how children come to acquire it, and how information is conveyed across multiple channels. 
We use insights from linguistics and cognitive science to advance data-efficient learning in LMs and 
interpret how LMs learn and represent grammatical structures and meaning. 

LeM🍋N Lab is based in the [Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/) 
and the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego.

Our PI is [Alex Warstadt](https://alexwarstadt.github.io/)
